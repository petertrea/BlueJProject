/**
 * 
 * Java uses System.out to refer to the standard output device and System.in to the
standard input device. By default, the output device is the display monitor and the input
device is the keyboard. To perform console output, you simply use the println method to
display a primitive value or a string to the console. Console input is not directly supported
in Java, but you can use the Scanner class to create an object to read input from System.in,
as follows:
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

The syntax new Scanner(System.in) creates an object of the Scanner type. The syntax
Scanner input declares that input is a variable whose type is Scanner. The whole line
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in) creates a Scanner object and assigns its
reference to the variable input. An object may invoke its methods. To invoke a method on
an object is to ask the object to perform a task. You can invoke the nextDouble() method to
read a double value as follows:
double radius = input.nextDouble();
